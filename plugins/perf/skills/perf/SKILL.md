# Performance Measurement Skill

Quick Lighthouse audit for web applications.

## Usage

### Commands

```bash
/perf                      # Audit current/main page
/perf /about               # Audit specific path
/perf https://example.com  # Audit full URL
/perf --all                # Audit all key pages
```

### Korean Triggers

- "성능 측정"
- "라이트하우스 돌려"
- "페이지 속도 확인"

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Target URLs

If `--all` or batch mode:

Scan for key pages:
- Homepage (`/`)
- Main feature pages
- High-traffic routes

### 2. Run Lighthouse

For each URL, invoke `web-perf-ux` skill or run directly:

```bash
lighthouse <url> --output=json --chrome-flags="--headless"
```

### 3. Collect Metrics

Focus on Core Web Vitals:

| Metric | Good | Needs Work | Poor |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | <2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | >4.0s |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | <0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | >0.25 |
| INP (Interaction to Next Paint) | <200ms | 200-500ms | >500ms |

Additional metrics:
- FCP (First Contentful Paint)
- TTFB (Time to First Byte)
- Total Blocking Time
- Speed Index

### 4. Generate Report

Summary format:

```
Performance Report
==================
/ (Homepage)
  LCP: 1.8s    CLS: 0.05   INP: 120ms   Score: 92

/dashboard
  LCP: 3.2s    CLS: 0.08   INP: 180ms   Score: 74
  Issues: LCP needs improvement

/products
  LCP: 2.1s    CLS: 0.02   INP: 95ms    Score: 89

Top Issues:
1. /dashboard - Large images not optimized
2. /dashboard - Render-blocking JavaScript
```

## Common Optimizations

Based on results, suggest:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| High LCP | Optimize images, preload critical assets |
| High CLS | Set image dimensions, avoid dynamic content insertion |
| High INP | Reduce JavaScript, use code splitting |
| High TTFB | Check server response, use CDN |

## Integration

This skill works best with `web-perf-ux` plugin for detailed analysis.

```bash
# For detailed analysis
/web-perf-ux https://example.com

# For quick check
/perf https://example.com
```

## Batch Mode

When running `--all`:

1. Discover routes from sitemap or router config
2. Queue pages for measurement
3. Run sequentially (avoid overwhelming server)
4. Aggregate results into single report
