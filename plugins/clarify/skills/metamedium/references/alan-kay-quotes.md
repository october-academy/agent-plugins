# Alan Kay Notes (Metamedium)

Selected concepts used by this skill:

- "A change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points."
- Computers are a metamedium: they can simulate existing media and invent new forms.

Practical implication:

- Coding is not only content production; it is form design.
- Reframing medium/format can unlock non-linear leverage.
