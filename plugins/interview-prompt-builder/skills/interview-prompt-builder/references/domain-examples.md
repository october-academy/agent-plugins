# Domain-Specific Interview Examples

Reference examples for different task types. Use these as starting points and adapt to user's specific needs.

## Document Writing

### Report/Proposal
```markdown
## Interview Topics
1. **Purpose**: What decision will this inform? Who approves?
2. **Audience**: Technical depth? What do they already know?
3. **Key message**: What's the one thing readers must remember?
4. **Evidence**: What data/examples support your argument?
5. **Structure**: Executive summary needed? Appendices?
6. **Constraints**: Page limit? Template required? Deadline?

## Interview Rules
- 2 questions per turn
- Challenge weak evidence ("What data supports this?")
- End when purpose, audience, and key message are crystal clear
```

### Creative Writing
```markdown
## Interview Topics
1. **Genre & tone**: What feeling should readers have?
2. **Characters**: Who are they? What do they want?
3. **Setting**: When/where? What rules govern this world?
4. **Conflict**: What's at stake? What obstacles exist?
5. **Theme**: What deeper meaning, if any?
6. **Style references**: What existing works inspire this?

## Interview Rules
- 1 question per turn (creative work needs space)
- Accept ambiguity ("I'll figure it out" is valid)
- End when core premise and tone are established
```

## Technical Tasks

### API/System Design
```markdown
## Interview Topics
1. **Problem**: What user need does this solve?
2. **Scope**: What's in v1? What's explicitly out?
3. **Constraints**: Performance requirements? Budget? Timeline?
4. **Integration**: What existing systems must it work with?
5. **Edge cases**: What unusual scenarios must be handled?
6. **Success metrics**: How will you know it works?

## Interview Rules
- 2 questions per turn
- Push for specifics ("Give me a concrete example")
- Require at least 3 edge cases before ending
```

### Code Refactoring
```markdown
## Interview Topics
1. **Pain points**: What's currently broken or slow?
2. **Constraints**: What must NOT change? (APIs, behavior)
3. **Goals**: Performance? Readability? Testability?
4. **Testing**: What test coverage exists? What's acceptable risk?
5. **Timeline**: Big bang or incremental?

## Interview Rules
- 1-2 questions per turn
- Clarify trade-offs ("If you had to choose between X and Y?")
- End when constraints and non-negotiables are explicit
```

## Strategy/Planning

### Product Roadmap
```markdown
## Interview Topics
1. **Vision**: Where should this product be in 1 year?
2. **Users**: Who are the primary personas? What do they need most?
3. **Competitors**: What do alternatives do well/poorly?
4. **Resources**: Team size? Budget? Technical constraints?
5. **Priorities**: What's the #1 thing to ship first? Why?
6. **Risks**: What could derail this plan?

## Interview Rules
- 2 questions per turn
- Challenge priorities ("Why this over that?")
- Require explicit trade-off decisions
```

### Learning/Training Plan
```markdown
## Interview Topics
1. **Goal**: What skill/knowledge? To what level?
2. **Current state**: What do you already know?
3. **Learning style**: Reading? Projects? Videos? Mentorship?
4. **Time**: Hours per week? Target completion date?
5. **Milestones**: How will you measure progress?
6. **Accountability**: Who/what keeps you on track?

## Interview Rules
- 1-2 questions per turn
- Push for realistic time estimates
- End when milestones are concrete and measurable
